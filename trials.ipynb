The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) is revising the codes for Rumination \\nDisorder with the applicable code depending on the age of the patient: F98.21 for rumination disorder in \\nin infants, children, and adolescents and a new ICD-10-CM code, F50.84, for rumination disorder in \\nadults. A coding note is being added to the diagnostic criteria for rumination disorder as follows: “The \\nICD-10-CM codes for rumination disorder are F98.21 in infants, children, and adolescents and F50.84 in \\nadults.” \\n \\nRumination disorder in adults – New code: F50.84 \\n \\nI.C Anorexia Nervosa \\nThe ICD-10-CM codes for anorexia nervosa, restricting type (F50.01), and anorexia nervosa, binge-eating \\npurging type (F50.02) have been revised to allow current severity or remission status to be indicated in \\nthe ICD-10-CM code; these changes will take effect October 1, 2024.

However, children whose irritability is present only in the context of a major \\ndepressive episode or persistent depressive disorder should receive one of those diagnoses rather than \\ndisruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder may have \\nsymptoms that also meet criteria for an anxiety disorder and can receive both diagnoses, but children \\nwhose irritability is manifest only in the context of exacerbation of an anxiety disorder should receive \\nthe relevant anxiety disorder diagnosis rather than disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.

Coding Updates:  \\n \\nI.A  Parkinson's Disease, Coding Change \\nThe ICD-10-CM code for Parkinson’s disease has changed from G20 to G20.C, reflecting a change to the \\nICD-10-CM code that takes effect on October 1, 2023. Note that G20.C is the code for Parkinson’s \\ndisease, unspecified. Additional codes are also newly available to indicate the presence or absence of \\ndyskinesia, with or without fluctuations, which do not appear in DSM-5-TR.  \\nThe ICD-10-CM code for Parkinson's disease (in the DSM-5-TR Classification [Major or Mild \\nNeurocognitive Disorder Due to Parkinson’s Disease], the Neurocognitive Disorders chapter [1) coding \\ntable, “Parkinson’s disease, probably due to”; and 2) criteria set for Major or Mild Neurocognitive \\nDisorder Due to Parkinson’s Disease], Alphabetical Listing and Numerical Listing of DSM-5-TR Diagnoses \\nand ICD-10-CM Codes of DSM-5-TR Diagnoses and ICD-10-CM Codes [all listings for “Major \\nneurocognitive disorder probably due to Parkinson’s disease” and “Mild neurocognitive disorder \\nprobably due to Parkinson’s disease”]) is revised as follows:  \\nParkinson's disease– Original code: G20 \\nParkinson's disease– Updated code: G20.C \\n \\nI.B  Inadequate Housing, Coding Change \\nThe ICD-10-CM code for Inadequate Housing (in the DSM-5-TR Classification [Other Conditions That \\nMay Be a Focus of Clinical Attention, “Housing Problems”], the Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of \\nClinical Attention chapter [“Housing Problems”], Alphabetical and Numerical Listing of DSM-5-TR \\nDiagnoses and ICD-10-CM Codes) is revised as follows:  \\nInadequate Housing – Original code: Z59.1 \\nInadequate Housing – Updated code: Z59.10 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \"), Document(metadata={'source': './data/DSM-5-TR.pdf', 'page': 25, 'page_label': '26'}, page_content='DSM-5-TRTM Update, September 2023, Page 3 of 5 \\nCopyright © 2023 American Psychiatric Association.

Text Updates \\n \\nII.A  Delusional Disorder, Differential Diagnosis: pp. 107-108 \\nReason for change: To clarify the boundary between delusional disorder and psychotic versions of some \\nof the Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders (e.g., body dysmorphic disorder with absent \\ninsight/delusional beliefs). \\n \\nOriginal text: \\nObsessive-compulsive and related disorders. If an individual with obsessive-compulsive disorder is \\ncompletely convinced that his or her obsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs are true, then the diagnosis \\nof obsessive-compulsive disorder, with absent insight/delusional beliefs specifier, should be given rather \\nthan a diagnosis of delusional disorder. Similarly, if an individual with body dysmorphic disorder is \\ncompletely convinced that his or her body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are true, then the diagnosis of \\nbody dysmorphic disorder, with absent insight/delusional beliefs specifier, should be given rather than a \\ndiagnosis of delusional disorder.  \\nRevised text: \\nObsessive-compulsive and related disorders. If an individual with obsessive-compulsive disorder, body \\ndysmorphic disorder, or hoarding disorder is completely convinced that his or her obsessive-compulsive \\nand related disorder beliefs are true, then the diagnosis is obsessive-compulsive disorder, body \\ndysmorphic disorder, or hoarding disorder, respectively, “with absent insight/delusional beliefs” \\nspecifier, rather than delusional disorder.  \\n \\nII.B  Schizophrenia, Differential Diagnosis: p. 120 \\nReason for change: To clarify the boundary between schizophrenia and psychotic versions of some of \\nthe Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders. \\n \\nOriginal text: \\nObsessive-compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder. Individuals with obsessive-compulsive \\ndisorder and body dysmorphic disorder may present with poor or absent insight, and the \\npreoccupations may reach delusional proportions. But these disorders are distinguished from \\nschizophrenia by their prominent obsessions, compulsions, preoccupations with appearance or body \\nodor, hoarding, or body-focused repetitive behaviors.  \\nRevised text: \\nObsessive compulsive and related disorders with poor or absent insight: When individuals are \\ncompletely convinced that their obsessive-compulsive beliefs, body dysmorphic disorder beliefs (e.g., \\ndefective physical appearance), or hoarding disorder beliefs (e.g., catastrophic consequences of \\ndiscarding objects) are true, the specifier “with absent insight/delusional beliefs” applies.

Another \\nimportant differentiating feature between schizophrenia and these disorders is that the latter are \\ncharacterized by prominent obsessions or preoccupations and the compulsive (repetitive) behaviors that \\noccur in response.  \\n \\nII.C  Conduct Disorder, Differential Diagnosis, p. 537 \\nReason for change: To align the differential diagnosis text for conduct disorder to be consistent with \\nCriterion E of adjustment disorders. \\n \\nOriginal text: \\nAdjustment disorders. The diagnosis of an adjustment disorder (with disturbance of conduct or with \\nmixed disturbance of emotions and conduct) should be considered if clinically significant conduct \\nproblems that do not meet the criteria for another specific disorder develop in clear association with the \\nonset of a psychosocial stressor and do not resolve within 6 months of the termination of the stressor \\n(or its consequences). Conduct disorder is diagnosed only when the conduct problems represent a \\nrepetitive and persistent pattern that is associated with impairment in social, academic, or occupational \\nfunctioning. \\nRevised text: \\nAdjustment disorders.

Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders \\nII.A  Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition (Coding Update to ICD-10-CM Medical \\nCodes Used as Examples) \\nThe ICD-10-CM code for Hepatic Encephalopathy (listed under Catatonic Disorder Due to \\nAnother Medical Condition) was revised as follows: \\nCoding note: The code for hepatic encephalopathy was revised as follows: \\nHepatic Encephalopathy - Original code (valid through September 30, 2022): K72.90 \\nHepatic Encephalopathy - Updated code (Valid on October 1, 2022): K76.82 \\n \\nIII.

Prolonged grief disorder is a persistent pervasive grief response that \\ncontinues to cause clinically significant distress or impairment for more than 12 months after \\nthe death of someone close. It can be differentiated from a major depressive episode not only \\nby the requirement for intense yearning or longing for, or preoccupation with, the deceased, \\nbut also by the requirement that the other symptoms such as emotional pain (e.g., anger, \\nbitterness, sorrow), marked reduction in emotional experiences, feeling that life is meaningless, \\nand difficulty reintegrating socially or feeling engaged in ongoing activities be judged to result \\nfrom the significant interpersonal loss. By contrast, in a major depressive episode, there is a \\nmore generalized depressed mood that is not specifically related to the loss. It should be noted \\nthat both prolonged grief disorder and major depressive disorder should be diagnosed if criteria \\nfor both are met.  \\n \\nV.

Neurocognitive Disorders \\nVII.A  Chapter Introduction (Text Update) \\nThe following text will be added to the chapter introduction before “Neurocognitive Domains” \\nsection: \\n For major and mild NCDs, the diagnostic criteria for several of the etiological subtypes allow for \\nthe designation of the degree of certainty regarding the possible presence of the medical \\nconditions, as well the strength of the causal connection between the medical condition and the \\nNCD. For NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal NCD, and NCD with Lewy bodies, \\nestablishing whether these medical conditions are present in the individual can be extremely \\nchallenging, and sometimes the etiology can only be firmly established postmortem; for these \\nsubtypes, the probable/possible designation precedes the name of the medical condition (e.g., \\nmild NCD due to possible Alzheimer’s disease, major NCD due to probable frontotemporal \\ndegeneration). Because the diagnostic criteria for vascular NCD and NCD due to Parkinson’s \\ndisease require clear evidence of the presence of vascular disease or Parkinson’s disease, \\nrespectively, for those subtypes the uncertainty is about the causal connection between the \\nmedical condition and the NCD. For those subtypes, the designations “probably due to” and \\n“possibly due to” apply.  \\n \\n \\n '), Document(metadata={'source': './data/DSM-5-TR.pdf', 'page': 34, 'page_label': '35'}, page_content=' \\n \\nDSM-5-TRTM Update, September 2022, Page 9 of 27 \\nCopyright © 2022 American Psychiatric Association.

The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder. \\nB. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that suggest the \\nneurocognitive disorder is the pathophysiological consequence of a presumed medical condition, \\na combination of med ical conditions, or a combination of medical conditions and substances or \\nmedications, but there is insufficient information to establish a specific cause. \\nC. The cognitive deficits are not better explained by another mental disorder or \\nsubstance/medication-induced neurocognitive disorder and do not occur exclusively during the \\ncourse of a delirium. \\nCoding note (see coding table on pp. 682–683): For major neurocognitive disorder (NCD) due to \\nunknown etiology: 1) code first F03 (there is no additional medical code). 2) Next, code the current \\nseverity of the cognitive disturbance (mild, moderate, severe) and 3) whether or not there is an \\naccompanying behavioral or psychological disturban ce. For example, for major NCD due to \\nunknown etiology, moderate, with psychotic disturbance, the ICD -10-CM code is F03.B2. For \\nmajor NCD with multiple clinically significant behavioral and psychological disturbances, multiple \\nICD-10-CM codes are needed. F or example, major NCD with unknown etiology, severe, \\naccompanied by agitation, delusions, and depression, three codes are needed: F03.C11 (with \\nagitation); F03.C2 (with psychotic disturbance); and F03.C3 (with mood symptoms). \\nFor mild NCD due to unknown etiology, code G31.84. (Note: “With behavioral disturbance” and \\n“Without behavioral disturbance” cannot be coded but should still be recorded.) \\nThis category is included to cover the clinical presentation of a major or mild neurocognitive \\ndisorder for which there is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings \\nsuggestive of a medical etiology or a medical etiology in combination with use of a substance or \\nmedication, but there is insufficient information to establish a specific cause. \\n \\nVII.I  Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder (Change in the Disorder Definition) \\nUnspecified neurocognitive disorder description was modified following the addition of “Major \\nor Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Unknown Etiology”: \\nThis category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a neurocognitive \\ndisorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other \\nimportant areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the \\ndisorders in the neurocognitive disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified neurocognitive \\ndisorder category is used in situations in which the precise etiology cannot be determined with \\nsufficient certainty to make an etiological attribution. \\nCoding note: For unspecified major or mild neurocognitive disorder, code R41.9.
